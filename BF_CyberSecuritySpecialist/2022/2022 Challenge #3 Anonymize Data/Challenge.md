# 2022 Challenge #3 Anonymize Data
## Process
- Created a script that connects to the .db file, retrieves data from a query, and generates a csv as an output.
- Created a template for other exercises like this one. The only thing to do is open the code in an IDE, change the query, and launch the script.
- I'll change that in the template, I want the query to be asked to the user. It would be cool to permit the user to have multiple lines in the input field instead of a long one-line query.
- For yet it works.
