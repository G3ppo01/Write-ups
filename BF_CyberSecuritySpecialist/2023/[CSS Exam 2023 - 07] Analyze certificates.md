# [CSS Exam 2023 - 07] Analyze certificates
## Task 1
- Scann the host with nmap: `nmap -Pn -p1-65535 --script ssl-cert [IP]`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da1a8807-25ba-4a84-88d1-6081f921a9f4)
- Open ports with certificate: 4443; 8080; 9990; 30443
- Port 4786; 8081; 21021 are open but no certificate.

## Task 2
- I will scan port 4443 with the command `sslscan [IP:PORT]` on a Kali VM to get the full certificate:

- We can see some security improvements to do by looking at it:
1. Disable SSL v3
2. Enable TLS v1.3
3. Disable weak ciphers (DHE 1024 bits ciphers; 128 bits ciphers like TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA or TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5)

## Task 3

## Task 4
Let's start with the root CA certificate, going to to the end certificate.

### Root CA
- Root CA is self-signed. Ss we don't need to download any CRL.
- We can check it against the chain:
- `openssl verify -verbose -CAfile chain.pem root_ca.pem`

### Intermediate 1 and 2
- This time, let's try downloading the CRL:
- `openssl verify -crl_download -crl_check -verbose -CAfile chain.pem cert.pem`
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fe37673-4226-4de0-91af-ee80562eed95)
- The certificates themself lack CRL information. (Could be because of certificate stapling). Let's check them like we did with the root CA certificate:
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43538f8b-eb61-4656-b2f7-75fb8736330a)

###â˜» Leaf certificate
- Let's reuse the command that permits to download the CRL:
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01da075f-08aa-4023-b65d-537f4165d6e5)
- The certificate is expired, therefore it is not trustworthy
